 * OSDev Wiki describes for kernel-level tasks: "The TCB holds task
 * state including the kernel stack pointer (ESP) ... " (OSDev Wiki,
 * "Kernel Multitasking": https://wiki.osdev.org/Kernel_Multitasking).
 * This kernel has no user/kernel privilege split and no per-task
 * address space yet -- every task here runs in ring 0 sharing the one
 * page directory Chapter 8 built -- so this TCB carries nothing for
 * CR3 or a TSS.ESP0 field the way a fuller kernel's would; `esp` is
 * almost the whole of what switch_task() needs. `entry` is new since
 * Chapter 12 -- see task_start_trampoline() below for why. `state`
 * replaces this struct's old plain `done` flag this chapter: a task
 * can now be BLOCKED (waiting on a semaphore, see 015_semaphore.c)
 * as well as READY or DONE, and the scheduler needs to tell all three
 * apart, not just "finished or not." */

 * switched into next inherits whatever IF happens to be at that exact
 * moment: 0, because we are still inside that interrupt handler. A
 * task resuming through task_yield()'s own return point can restore
 * that itself (see below); but a task running for the very first
