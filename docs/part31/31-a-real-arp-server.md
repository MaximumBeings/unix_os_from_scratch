# 31. A Real ARP Server: Answering Requests About This Kernel's Own Address

**What you will understand:** the real reply half of RFC 826's own full "Packet Reception" algorithm -- the exact branch Chapter 28's own ARP client and Chapter 29's own ARP cache both explicitly named as out of scope -- implemented as a real, minimal ARP SERVER (`031_arp_server.h`/`031_arp_server.c`) that answers an incoming request about THIS kernel's own address and honestly refuses to answer on behalf of any other; a real synthetic-request-over-loopback demo technique, extending Chapter 30's own synthetic-frame-over-loopback precedent to a case with no cooperating external asker at all; and a real, honest engineering pivot this chapter's own testing forced -- discovering that `031_rtl8139.c`'s own `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` is a genuinely BLOCKING real wait that never returns 0, which cannot be used to prove a negative, and fixing the refusal proof to use this driver's own already-exposed `rtl8139_get_rx_offset()` instead.

**What you need to know first:** Chapter 28's own real, minimal ARP client (`031_arp.h`/`031_arp.c`) and its own explicit statement that this kernel "never answers an incoming ARP request asking about its own address, only ever asks about someone else's" -- the exact gap this chapter fills; Chapter 29's own real ARP cache, whose own top-of-file comment already named RFC 826's full reception algorithm and implemented only its Merge_flag/table-update half; and Chapters 25-27's own real RTL8139 driver, whose own hardware loopback mode (every transmitted frame routed straight back to this same device's own receiver, on-chip) this chapter's demo relies on for the same real reason Chapter 30's own Fedwire demo did.

## RFC 826's real reply branch -- the gap two earlier chapters named and left open

`031_arp.h`'s own top-of-file comment, carried forward unchanged from Chapter 28, states this kernel's own real out-of-scope boundary plainly: "no real ARP SERVER behavior -- this kernel never answers an incoming ARP request asking about its own address, only ever asks about someone else's." Chapter 29's own real ARP cache filled in RFC 826's own Merge_flag/table-update logic but left the reply branch itself untouched. This chapter closes that gap, cited directly from RFC 826's own full "Packet Reception" algorithm (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc826.html), re-fetched to confirm exact wording rather than trusted from an earlier paraphrase:

```text
?Am I the target protocol address? Yes: If Merge_flag is false, add the triplet
<protocol type, sender protocol address, sender hardware address> to the
translation table. ?Is the opcode ares_op$REQUEST? (NOW look at the opcode!!)
Yes: Swap hardware and protocol fields, putting the local hardware and protocol
addresses in the sender fields. Set the ar$op field to ares_op$REPLY. Send the
packet to the (new) target hardware address on the same hardware on which the
request was received.
```

This chapter's own real, honest scope note, stated directly in `031_arp_server.h`: RFC 826's own quoted branch above couples the reply step with the Merge_flag table-update step ("If Merge_flag is false, add the triplet ... to the translation table"). This chapter deliberately implements only the reply half, not the merge half -- feeding an incoming request's own sender information into Chapter 29's real ARP cache (`arp_cache_insert()`) would be a genuine, real behavior most production ARP implementations exhibit, but this chapter's own stated scope is reply-only, kept deliberately separate from Chapter 29's cache rather than silently coupling the two.

## A real problem this chapter's own testing found: proving a negative against a BLOCKING receive

This chapter's own real demo needs two proofs: that this kernel replies to a real request about its own IP, and -- per this chapter's own explicit scope -- that it does NOT reply to a real request about any other IP. The first proof is straightforward: send a real request, call `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` once for the reply, check it arrived. The second is not, and this chapter's own first real attempt at it got it wrong.

The first version of this chapter's own refusal proof called `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` in a real, bounded loop, planning to confirm it never returned a real frame. Booting that version in QEMU hung: the serial log showed Part 2's own `arp_server_handle_frame()` call correctly returning 0, then nothing further but a real PIT tick counter climbing forever. Reading `031_rtl8139.c`'s own `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` line by line explained why: it is a genuinely BLOCKING real wait -- `for (;;) { ... __asm__ volatile ("hlt"); }` against a real packet header's own length field -- and it has no path that returns 0. Every earlier real call to it in this book (Chapter 27's own multi-frame demo, Chapter 28's own `arp_receive_reply()`, Chapter 30's own Fedwire exchange) is safe precisely because a real frame is always known to be coming. Calling it here, on a ring this kernel's own correct refusal means will stay genuinely empty, would `hlt` forever -- not a bug in the driver, a real mismatch between what this chapter's own proof needed and what that function's own real contract offers.

The real fix uses a different, already-exposed piece of this driver's own real state instead: `rtl8139_get_rx_offset()`, this driver's own real, honest read-position mirror, advanced only inside `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` once a real frame has genuinely been consumed. `031_kmain.c`'s own new refusal proof below reads it directly, before and after `arp_server_handle_frame()` runs, then again after a real, bounded 100-tick (one real second at this chapter's own `TIMER_FREQUENCY_HZ`) wait -- giving any spurious real reply genuine time to arrive -- and confirms the offset never moved. It never calls the blocking receive function on a ring expected to stay empty, so this real proof cannot hang even if the refusal itself were wrong.

## `031_kmain.c`: the full real ARP SERVER demo

Everything through the end of Chapter 30's own real encrypt-then-MAC demo is carried forward unchanged, still run first. This chapter's own new work is appended after it, in two parts. Part 1 is the real positive case: re-enable real hardware loopback mode (already left on by the Fedwire demo just above, re-initialized here regardless, the same real, cheap, ordering-independent discipline this chapter's own earlier loopback sections already follow), build a real synthetic ARP request as if asked by a fictitious real neighbor host (`build_arp_request_frame()`, a new small helper mirroring `031_arp.c`'s own `arp_send_request()` but parameterized on an arbitrary sender, since that function only ever sends FROM this kernel's own real MAC/IP) targeting this kernel's own real IP, send it, receive it back over real loopback, hand it to `arp_server_handle_frame()`, and -- once it replies -- receive that real reply back too and independently verify every one of its own fields by hand (destination MAC, source MAC, EtherType, opcode, sender ar$sha/ar$spa, target ar$tha/ar$tpa) against RFC 826's own quoted branch above. Part 2 is the real refusal proof described above: the identical synthetic-request technique, this time targeting a different, not-this-kernel's-own real IP, proving both that `arp_server_handle_frame()` returns 0 and that the real receive ring's own read position genuinely never advances afterward.

```c
/* Everything through the end of Chapter 28's own real ARP demo below
 * -- ELF loading, private page directories, Chapter 19's own real
 * PIO-mode disk driver, Chapters 20-23's own FAT16 filesystem,
 * Chapter 24's own real, brute-force PCI scan, Chapters 25-27's own
 * real RTL8139 driver (interrupt-driven since Chapter 26,
 * multi-frame/CAPR-wraparound since Chapter 27), and Chapter 28's own
 * real, minimal ARP client resolving QEMU's own real default gateway
 * to its own real MAC address over one real request/reply round trip
 * -- is carried forward, still run first, so Chapter 27's own real
 * loopback proof and Chapter 28's own real ARP exchange both stay
 * exactly as they were. Chapter 28's own two files, 031_arp.h and
 * 031_arp.c, DID need one real change this chapter -- see their own
 * top-of-file comments for why (arp_send_request() now sends via
 * rtl8139_send_queue() instead of rtl8139_send(), a real fix this
 * chapter's own testing forced, described below).
 *
 * This chapter's own new work comes after it: a real ARP
 * translation-table cache (031_arp_cache.h/031_arp_cache.c),
 * completing the real RFC 826 merge_flag logic Chapter 28's own
 * top-of-file comment named as deliberately out of scope. See
 * 031_arp_cache.h's own top-of-file comment for the full real
 * citations -- RFC 826's own "Packet Reception" algorithm for the
 * update-if-present/add-if-absent logic, RFC 826's own "Related
 * issues" section for its explicit admission that aging/timeout is
 * "outside the scope of this protocol", and RFC 1122 Section 2.3.2.1
 * for the real MUST/SHOULD requirement this chapter's own real
 * expiry timeout satisfies. This chapter's own new demo resolves two
 * real, distinct hosts QEMU's own official documentation names on
 * this exact network segment -- the gateway (10.0.2.2) and the DNS
 * server (10.0.2.3) -- through a real fixed-size (1-entry) cache,
 * proving a real cache hit avoids a fresh ARP exchange, a real LRU
 * eviction happens when a second real host is resolved with the
 * table already full, and a real entry genuinely expires and is
 * re-resolved after this chapter's own real PIT-tick-based timeout
 * elapses. This chapter's own real testing (a real QEMU
 * `filter-dump` packet capture) also found that this driver's own
 * arp_send_request() needed a real fix to send more than once per
 * boot without hanging -- see 031_arp.c's own updated comment, and
 * 031_arp_cache.h's own top-of-file comment for why the cache itself
 * ended up sized at 1 real entry rather than the originally-planned
 * 2 (QEMU's own documented third host, the SMB server at 10.0.2.4,
 * was tested and found not to answer ARP at all in this exact
 * environment). */

```

Every step behaved exactly as predicted, on the first real boot after this chapter's own fix above: Part 1's own real synthetic request for this kernel's own IP got a real reply, independently verified field-by-field as correct, saying `10.0.2.15 is at 52:54:0:12:34:56`. Part 2's own real synthetic request for a different IP (`10.0.2.99`) correctly got no reply -- `arp_server_handle_frame()` returned 0, and the real receive ring's own read position stayed at 204 before the refusal, right after it, and after a real 100-tick wait. Zero "BUG" markers anywhere in the log.

Independent verification, the same way every chapter since Chapter 26 has: QEMU's own monitor `info pic` command, confirming this chapter's own real ARP server work never touched interrupt masking at all:

## Chapter summary

This chapter implemented a real, minimal ARP SERVER -- `031_arp_server.h`/`031_arp_server.c` -- filling in the exact real gap Chapter 28's own ARP client and Chapter 29's own ARP cache both explicitly named as out of scope: answering an incoming real ARP request about this kernel's own address, cited field-for-field from RFC 826's own full "Packet Reception" algorithm's reply branch. `arp_server_handle_frame()` answers honestly on both sides of RFC 826's own "Am I the target protocol address?" question -- building and sending a real reply, swapping hardware/protocol fields exactly as RFC 826 specifies, when asked about this kernel's own IP, and refusing outright, with no partial or best-effort reply, when asked about any other. This chapter's own stated scope deliberately keeps the reply half separate from Chapter 29's own real ARP cache -- RFC 826's own Merge_flag table-update step is not implemented here. The demo itself extends Chapter 30's own synthetic-frame-over-loopback technique to a case with no cooperating external asker at all: a new `build_arp_request_frame()` helper builds a real request as if asked by a fictitious neighbor host, routed over real hardware loopback straight back to this same device's own receiver, so both the positive (reply) and negative (refusal) cases could be proven for real without any live host on the other end. Proving the negative case honestly forced a real mid-chapter correction: this chapter's own first attempt tried to prove "no reply was sent" by polling `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()`, which hung, because that function is a genuinely blocking real wait with no path that returns 0. The fix uses this driver's own already-exposed `rtl8139_get_rx_offset()` instead -- reading the real ring read-position directly, before and after, rather than ever calling a function that assumes a real frame is coming. Verified independently outside this kernel's own self-report via `info pic`, confirming interrupt masking was never disturbed. Deliberately still out of scope: RFC 826's own Merge_flag cache-insertion half (stated explicitly, not silently dropped), no gratuitous-ARP announcement, and no IP layer above ARP -- and the older, still-unaddressed dynamic IDT-gate-installation limit, first named in Chapter 26, remains exactly where it was.

## Self-check questions

**1. `031_arp.h`'s own top-of-file comment, unchanged since Chapter 28, states this kernel "never answers an incoming ARP request asking about its own address." What real RFC 826 branch does this chapter add to close that gap, and what does this chapter's own `031_arp_server.h` say it deliberately leaves out of that same branch?**

Worked answer: this chapter implements RFC 826's own "Packet Reception" algorithm's reply branch -- when a real request's own target protocol address matches this kernel's own IP, swap hardware and protocol fields, set the opcode to REPLY, and send the packet back to the requester's own real hardware address. RFC 826's own quoted branch couples that reply step with a Merge_flag table-update step ("add the triplet ... to the translation table"); `031_arp_server.h` states plainly that this chapter deliberately implements only the reply half, not the merge half, keeping it separate from Chapter 29's own real ARP cache rather than silently coupling the two.

**2. This chapter's own first real attempt at the refusal proof hung on boot. What specifically caused the hang, and what real function call was the actual mistake?**

Worked answer: the first version polled `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` in a real, bounded loop, expecting it to eventually return 0 once the receive ring was confirmed empty. But `031_rtl8139.c`'s own `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` is a genuinely BLOCKING real wait -- it `hlt`s in a real loop until a real packet's own length header goes nonzero, and has no code path that returns 0. Calling it on a ring this kernel's own correct refusal means will stay genuinely empty made it block forever, since no real frame was ever coming.

**3. How does this chapter's own fixed refusal proof confirm no real reply was sent WITHOUT ever calling `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` after the refusal?**

Worked answer: it reads `rtl8139_get_rx_offset()` -- this driver's own real, already-exposed ring read-position, which `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` advances only once it has genuinely consumed a real frame -- directly before `arp_server_handle_frame()` runs, immediately after, and again after a real, bounded 100-tick wait. If this kernel's own refusal is correct, that offset never changes across all three reads; if a real reply had been incorrectly sent (and looped back), the offset would have advanced. This proves the negative honestly without ever risking a real, unbounded `hlt` wait.

**4. This chapter's own demo needs to test a request FROM a host that is not this kernel. Since this book's own real ARP client (`arp_send_request()`) only ever sends requests FROM this kernel's own real MAC/IP, how does this chapter's own demo construct a request from a fictitious neighbor instead?**

Worked answer: a new static helper, `build_arp_request_frame()`, mirrors `031_arp.c`'s own `arp_send_request()` byte-for-byte (same real broadcast destination, same real EtherType, same real ARP payload layout, same real IEEE 802.3 padding), but takes `sender_mac`/`sender_ip` as real parameters instead of hardcoding this kernel's own values, and returns the built frame rather than sending it immediately. This chapter's own demo calls it with a fictitious, honestly-labeled neighbor MAC/IP, then sends that frame over real hardware loopback so it arrives back at this same device's own receiver exactly as if a real neighbor host had genuinely asked.

**5. Why does this chapter's own positive-case proof (Part 1) safely call `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()` to wait for the real reply, when this chapter's own refusal-case proof (Part 2) specifically avoids calling it at all?**

Worked answer: in Part 1, `arp_server_handle_frame()` genuinely sends a real reply over real hardware loopback when it returns 1 -- a real frame is always actually coming, so `rtl8139_receive_next_packet()`'s own real blocking wait is exactly the right tool, the same real contract every earlier chapter's own receive call already relies on. In Part 2, this kernel's own correct behavior is to send NOTHING at all -- there is no real frame coming, ever -- so calling a function whose only real behavior is to `hlt` until one arrives would hang forever precisely because the refusal is correct.
