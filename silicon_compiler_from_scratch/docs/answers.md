## Chapter 1: The Flow

**1. Why does the testbench compare with `!==` and not `!=`, and what would a plain `!=` let through?**

Worked answer: `!=` returns *unknown* (`x`) when either side contains an `x` or `z` bit, and an `if` on an unknown condition is treated as false, so the mismatch branch is silently skipped. A wire that nothing drives (for instance the output of a stage that was never built) is `x`, so with `!=` a broken circuit whose outputs are `x` would be reported as correct. `!==` compares the four-state values literally, so `x` never equals a known bit and the mismatch is counted.

**2. The golden model enumerates all 512 inputs. Roughly how many inputs does a circuit with two 32-bit operands have, and what does that do to the idea of "exhaustive"?**

Worked answer: 2^64 (about 1.8 x 10^19) operand pairs, times 2 for a carry-in. At a billion tests per second that is about 600 years, so exhaustive testing is impossible. Testing then relies on directed corner cases, random inputs, structural arguments (a 32-bit adder is built from the same stage repeated, so testing small widths exhaustively says a lot) and, in this book, mutation counts that show how much a pass is worth.

**3. Yosys reports 20 gates for the adder and 9 lookup tables for the same design. Why is neither number "wrong", and which would you quote for a chip?**

Worked answer: they count different things. A standard-cell chip is built from fixed small gates, so a gate count (and, with a library, an area) is the relevant figure; an FPGA is built from programmable lookup tables, so a LUT count is. The same logic packs differently into each. For a chip you would quote the gates or cell area after mapping to the process's real cell library, which this book does not have, so it quotes the generic-gate count and labels it as such.

**4. A testbench that tried only `cin = 0` would miss exactly one of the ten mutants. Which one, and why does that make exhaustiveness valuable?**

Worked answer: the mutant that ties the carry-in to zero (`assign c[0] = 1'b0;`). With `cin` always 0 the tied-off circuit behaves identically, so a test that never sets `cin` to 1 cannot tell them apart; the other nine mutants change behaviour even with `cin = 0`. This is the typical way a weak test fails: not by missing the big mistakes but by never exercising the input that distinguishes one particular mistake. Exhaustive testing leaves no such input unexercised.

**5. A mutant survives. What is the first question to ask, and what are the two possible answers?**

Worked answer: "Is this mutant equivalent to the original?", that is, does it behave identically for every possible input? If it does (like writing `a | b` for `a ^ b` in the carry's propagate term), the survivor is harmless and no test could ever catch it; it should be reported and set aside. If it does not, there is an input on which the circuit differs and the test never tried it: a gap in the test, which the fix is to close by adding that input.
